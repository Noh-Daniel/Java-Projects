These are some coding projects ive been working on since the start of 2025 to help me learn java. They start of really basic but get to advanced material. 
The most advanced projects would be the AxQy projects, as those are projects where I apply all my learning. As the x gets larger (A1, A2, A3) it becomes more complicated. 
I do these projects because of my love and passion for computer science
